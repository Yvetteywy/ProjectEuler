Q: A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,

	a2 + b2 = c2
	For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

	There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
	Find the product abc.




For this question I did not program, but used Math to calculate.

	a + b + c = 1000 
	=> (a + b + c)^2 = 1000000
	=> a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 1000000
	since 
		a^2 + b^2 = c^2
	=> 2(b + c) (a + c) = 100000
	=> ( b + c ) ( a + c ) = 500000
	
	since 
		a + b + c = 1000
	=> ( 1000 - a ) ( a + c ) = 5000000
	both ( 1000 - a ) and ( a + c ) are less than 1000.

	factoring 500000 into two numbers that are less than 10000
	got 625 and 800
	test them, then got 
		a = 375, b = 200, c = 425
